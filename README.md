# Practical Machining Learning Course Project

## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement ¨C a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, my goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

## Data

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you are going to use the data for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used.

## Assignment

The goal of my project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. I will use some of the other variables to predict with. I will create a report describing how I built my model, how I used cross validation, what I think the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the choices I did. I will also use my prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
